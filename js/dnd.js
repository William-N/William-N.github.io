                North of the Jansen and Vevide lie the island of Caybluff and its people. With a long history of conquest by the Cirilians,
                Godobald, and most recently the Jansen, before gaining independence. Though they claim to be their own people,
                the influence of other civilizations has changed the course of Caybluffian history. 
                Originally a subculture of the northern Godobaldians, the Bluffians invaded the former Cirilian territory with survivors of the empire
                and the local Caydian inhabitants. After four decades of fighting, the capital of Caydian was renamed to Caybluff to represent peace between
                the two people. Marriage resulted in a rapid synthesis of the two cultures and a newly defined royal class.
                After the conflict settled, boats were dispatched to Anes to explore the formerly Cirlian lands and create a ground for future expansion. 
                Unable to claim the entire southern coast, the king of Upper Godobald brokered an agreement with the then queen of Caybluff to divide the land
                and protect each other from foreign or domestic colonial threats.

                Mountains mostly separate the Tehueypac from the other civilizations of Durios. As the continent curves east, one can find the Godobald people.
                A massive culture group containing people from differing climates and biomes, they are united through their stories and traditions of fighting the
                Cirilians centuries ago. Having evolved technologically since such battles, the Godobald collectives are forming new governments and societies within
                themselves. Region originated as tribal society united against Cirilian Empire invasion of south. Tribes last united by King Mariwig Adald, or Mariwig
                the Noble. Vast Kingdom split by five sons who wared in the resulting 3 kingdoms and a derivative Vevide kingdom to the east (Upper & Lower Godobald, Gratus, Vevide).
                Hardcore feudal society, barons, counts, dukes, kings, but no emperors… yet. Most of land congregated by dukes, only 1 kingdom prevented internal warfare in legal code
                (King Vaefar of Upper Godobald). Upper Godobald wealthier of Godobald kingdoms given port and trade. o Negotiate cooperation pact with Caybluff to peacefully settle
                former Cirilian lands and trade by splitting the continent in half, east (Godobald) and west (Caybluff). • Like most vegetation on Lokali, grains are thicker and denser
                than on other worlds. o Unlike in other cultures however, Godobaldians do not attempt to thin out their food, and eat less of dense meals. 
                Class system relies highly on warfare, low born are picked to inherit lands based on martial ability. Rebellions often result in local despots being 
                overthrown by great warriors. • Desire to expand lands and exploit resources comes from trade with Arilians. To rival them in wealth, lands of Cirilian Empire
                are explored, and land given to the best warriors.

                Separated by a narrow sea in all parts but the most southern snowy plain, the Vevide are bordered by the Skoro raiders,
                who thrive in the heat of battle. South of the Vevide and Skoro are small enclaves of Tizarnian people who are brave enough to be open
                targets to the Skoro raiders. With a majority of the seasons being cold and not optimal for agriculture, grains are thinner than across the rest of the world,
                and diets consist of more livestock, which can be sustained on the thinner grains of barely. • Originally stratified by a system of warrior classes, wealth
                through sea travel raids brought change to the social structure of the land. Those who did not raid foreign shores attempted to raid local ones,
                but a new system of tribal lords would defend the local shores while foreign raiders would plunder abroad. This created a divide between the loosely
                organized tribes and those highly organized ones which exchanged food for protection. • Most loose tribes do not attempt to raid alone anymore and live
                off the remote mountains on the eastern coast of the continent. These tribes are fleeting, every season more and more tribes people assimilate into the
                highly organized tribes. • With some of the most sophisticated boats on the planet, the Skoro sail past Caybluff through the hard seas of the world,
                onto both Anes and other continents throughout the world. • As local strife lessens, conflict turns towards raiding the world, fueling the local regional
                wealth. Defended by mountains from the west, it is neigh impossible for war to conquer the Skoro through warfare. • The Cirilian Empire from Anes attempted
                to wage war on the coasts of Skoro in eras past, leading to generations of hardened warriors to emerge. The Skoro learned from the Cirilian boat designs how
                to cross the hard seas by deconstructing their technology and improving on it. The result was orchestrated raids on Cirilian lands and the start of the
                raiding culture on Anes and the wider world.
